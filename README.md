Project Euler problems solved on Jupyter notebook
=================================================

Â 
Analyze and solve problems in [Project Euler](<https://projecteuler.net/>)
using Jupyter Notebook.



Rules 
-----
- Do not use third-party libraries (like `sympy`, `scipy`) to solve the problems.
- But it's OK to use these libraries as a separate reference solution
